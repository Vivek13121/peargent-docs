  Ready-to-use tools that extend agent capabilities with powerful built-in
  functionality
</h3>

Peargent provides a growing collection of built-in **<u>[Tools](/docs/tools)</u>** that solve common tasks without requiring custom implementations. These tools are production-ready, well-tested, and integrate seamlessly with **<u>[Agents](/docs/agents)</u>**.

## Why Built-in Tools?

Built-in tools save development time and provide:

- **Zero Configuration** - Import and use immediately, no setup required
- **Production Ready** - Thoroughly tested and optimized for reliability
- **Best Practices** - Built with proper error handling, validation, and security
- **Consistent API** - Same interface patterns across all built-in tools
- **Maintained** - Regular updates and improvements from the Peargent team

## Available Built-in Tools

### Text Extraction Tool

Extract plain text and metadata from various document formats including HTML, PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, and URLs.

```python
from peargent.tools import text_extractor

# Extract text from a document
result = text_extractor.run({
    "file_path": "document.pdf",
    "extract_metadata": True
})

print(result["text"])
print(result["metadata"])
```

**Supported formats:**

- HTML/XHTML with metadata extraction
- PDF documents with metadata
- Microsoft Word (DOCX) documents
- Plain text files with encoding detection
- Markdown files
- URLs with SSRF protection

## Using Built-in Tools with Agents

Built-in tools work exactly like custom tools. Simply import and pass them to the agent's `tools` parameter:

```python
from peargent import create_agent
from peargent.tools import text_extractor # [!code highlight]
from peargent.models import openai

agent = create_agent(
    name="DocumentAnalyzer",
    description="Analyzes documents and extracts key information",
    persona="You are a document analysis expert",
    model=openai("gpt-4o"),
    tools=[text_extractor] # [!code highlight]
)

response = agent.run("Summarize the key points from research_paper.pdf")
```

The agent automatically knows how to use the tool based on its description and parameters.

## Coming Soon

More built-in tools are in development:

- **Web Search Tool** - Search the web and retrieve relevant information
- **Image Analysis Tool** - Extract text and analyze images
- **File System Tool** - Read, write, and manage files safely
- **HTTP Request Tool** - Make API calls with built-in retry logic

Check the [Peargent GitHub repository](https://github.com/peargent-ai/peargent) for the latest updates.
