  Timeouts let you set a maximum allowed execution time for a tool.
</h3>

If the **<u>Tool</u>** takes longer than the configured time, its execution is stopped and handled using on_error.

**Timeouts** are extremely useful for:

* Preventing tools from hanging forever
* Stopping slow external operations
* Keeping agent response times predictable
* Automatically failing or retrying long-running tasks

## Enable Timeout in a Tool

```python
from peargent import create_tool

slow_tool = create_tool(
    name="slow_operation",
    description="Operation that may take too long",
    input_parameters={"data": dict},
    call_function=slow_processing,
    timeout=5.0,          # Maximum 5 seconds allowed // [!code highlight]
    on_error="return_error"
)
```

## How Timeout Works

<div className='fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step'>
1. Tool starts executing normally
2. A timer begins (based on timeout)
3. If execution finishes in time → result is returned
4. If it exceeds the timeout →
    * Execution is stopped
    * A TimeoutError is raised internally
    * Result is handled via on_error

5. If combined with retries, timeout is applied on every attempt
</div>

## Timeout Example with Retries
```python
robust_tool = create_tool(
    name="robust_api",
    description="API call with timeout + retries",
    input_parameters={"query": str},
    call_function=call_api,
    timeout=10.0,        # Max 10 seconds per attempt // [!code highlight]
    max_retries=3,       # Retry if timed out
    retry_delay=2.0,
    retry_backoff=True,
    on_error="return_error"
)

# Example timing if every attempt times out:
# Attempt 1: 10s timeout
# Wait 2s
# Attempt 2: 10s timeout
# Wait 4s
# Attempt 3: 10s timeout
# Wait 8s
# Attempt 4: 10s timeout
# → Final failure handled by on_error
```
