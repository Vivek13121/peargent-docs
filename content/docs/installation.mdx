  Get started with installing Peargent in your Python environment.
</h3>
To install Peargent **<u>[python package](https://pypi.org/project/peargent/)</u>**, you can use `pip` or `uv`. It's recommended to install **Peargent** inside a **virtual environment (venv)** to manage dependencies effectively.

```bash
pip install peargent
```
```bash
uv pip install peargent
```

If you don't have a virtual environment set up, you can create one using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

After activating the virtual environment, run the pip install command above to install **Peargent**.
