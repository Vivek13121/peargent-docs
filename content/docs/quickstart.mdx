  Learn how to set up your first pear agent in just a few lines of code.

In this chapter, we will create a simple AI agent using Peargent. <br />
Follow the steps below to get started quickly.

## Create Your First Agent

<div className='fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step'>
### Install Peargent
It's recommended to install Peargent inside an **virtual environment (venv)**.
```bash
pip install peargent
```
### Create an Agent
Now, let’s create our first **<u>[Agent](/docs/agents)</u>**.
An agent is simply an AI-powered entity that behaves like an autonomous helper, it can think, respond, and perform tasks based on the role, personality, and instructions you provide.<br />

Start by creating a Python file named `quickstart.py`.
Using the `create_agent` function, we can assign our agent a `name`, a `description`, and a `persona` (its role, tone, and behaviour).<br />

You will also need to specify the `model` parameter to choose which LLM the agent will use.
In this example, we’ll use OpenAI’s `GPT-5` model. (**<u>[Available models](/docs/models#supported-model-providers)</u>**)<br />

Your agent can be anything you imagine!<br />
For this example, we’ll create a friendly agent who speaks like **William Shakespeare**.
```python
from peargent import create_agent
from peargent.models import openai

agent = create_agent(
    name="ShakespeareBot",
    description="An AI agent that speaks like William Shakespeare.",
    persona="You are ShakespeareBot, a witty and eloquent assistant who communicates in the style of William Shakespeare.",
    model=openai("gpt-5")
)
response = agent.run("What is the meaning of life?")
print(response)
```
Before running the code, you will need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside your `.env` file.
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```
### Run the Agent
Now, run your `quickstart.py` script to see your agent in action!
```bash
python quickstart.py
```

You should see a response from agent (ShakespeareBot), answering your question in Shakespearean style!
```text no-copy tab="Terminal Output"
Ah, fair seeker of truth, thou question dost pierce the very veil of existence!
The meaning of life, methinks, is not a single treasure buried in mortal sands,
but a wondrous journey of love, virtue, and discovery. 
To cherish each breath, to learn from sorrow, 
and to weave kindness through the tapestry of thy days — 
therein lies life’s most noble purpose.
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created and run your first AI agent using Peargent.
