  Use different model providers in your Agents and Pools.
</h3>

Models define which LLM your **<u>[Agent](/docs/agents)</u>** or **<u>[Pool](/docs/pools)</u>** uses. Peargent provides a simple, unified interface for connecting to different providers (OpenAI, Groq, Gemini, etc.).

Think of a Model as the brain of your **<u>[Agent](/docs/agents)</u>** or **<u>[Pool](/docs/pools)</u>**, the thing that actually generates responses.

## Creating a Model
Models are imported from peargent.models and created using simple factory functions:
```python
from peargent.models import openai, groq, gemini, anthropic

model = openai("gpt-4o")
# or
model = anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
```
You can run the model directly to get a response:
```python
response = model.generate("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)
```

### Passing model to Agent or Pool
```python
from peargent import create_agent, create_pool
from peargent.models import openai

agent = create_agent(
    name="Researcher",
    description="You are a researcher who can answer questions about the world.",
    persona="You are a researcher who can answer questions about the world.",
    model=openai("gpt-4o")
)
pool = create_pool(
    agents=[agent],
    model=openai("gpt-4o")
)
```
## Supported Model Providers

Peargent’s model support is continuously expanding. New providers and model families are added regularly, so expect this list to grow over time.

```python tab="OpenAI"
from peargent.models import openai

model = openai(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    api_key="sk-",
    endpoint_url="https://api.openai.com/v1",
    parameters={}
)
```
```python tab="Groq"
from peargent.models import groq

model = groq(
    model_name="llama-3.3",
    api_key="",
    endpoint_url="https://api.groq.com/v1",
    parameters={}
)
```
```python tab="Gemini"
from peargent.models import gemini

model = gemini(
    model_name="gemini-2.0-flash",
    api_key="AIzaSyB",
    endpoint_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1",
    parameters={}
)
```
```python tab="Anthropic"
from peargent.models import anthropic

model = anthropic(
    model_name="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    api_key="sk-ant-",
    endpoint_url="https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
    parameters={}
)
```
